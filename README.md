# Help us to make it better #
The most annoying problem is the HDMI output issue.And another thing is that you can't update the VoodooI2C driver which is working fine in Ventura,but i don't guarantee that it will still work well in the future.
I have tried to work on the SSDT file,but it was not working either.And I sincerely ask for help about it.By the way,I am an individual rather than a team.
